* Strategy 7.1: Fully engage all stakeholders that have the potential to have a positive
impact on patient safety.
* Strategy 7.2: Promote a common understanding and shared commitment among all stakeholders to successfully deliver the global patient safety action plan.
* Strategy 7.3: Establish networks and convene consultative meetings to foster collaboration and partnership in patient safety.
* Strategy 7.4: Promote cross geographical and multisectoral initiatives to advance action on patient safety.
* Strategy 7.5: Work closely with technical programmes to ensure alignment in patient safety action.

Refer to [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan) for the detailed framework for action through the 7 Strategic Objectives and 35 strategies. Each strategy is further operationalized into suggested actions for four key groups or categories of partners: governments, health care facilities and services, stakeholders and the WHO Secretariat.
