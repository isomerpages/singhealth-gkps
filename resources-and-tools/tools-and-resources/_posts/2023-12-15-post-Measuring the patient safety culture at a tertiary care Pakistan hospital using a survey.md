<p>Safety culture measurement is feasible and informative in developing countries
and could be broadly implemented to inform patient safety efforts. Current
data suggest that it compares favorably with benchmarks from hospitals
in the USA. Like the USA, high staff workload is a significant safety concern
among staff.</p>
<p>This study lays the foundation for further context-specific research on
patient safety culture in developing countries.</p>
