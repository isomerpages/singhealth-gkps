Patient and Family Engagement Co-Creation Consensus Workshop was held at
the <a href="https://www.iapo.org.uk/asia-pacific-patients-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3rd Asia-Pacific Patients Congress 2021 </a>.</p>
<p>The workshop was crafted to support Strategic Objective 4, which advocates
for Engaging and Empowering Patients and Families to help and support the
journey to safer health care. It brought together various stakeholders,
particularly patients and patient advocates to discuss how they can share
views and suggest action plans to contribute in accelerating GPSAP 2021-2030,
Strategic Objective 4.</p>
<p>Voices from patients offers a different perspective in the care process
and it is important to integrate their opinions into designing a safer
health care system. For patients to be empowered, all stakeholders in the
health system need to recognize the importance of shared decision.</p>
