<p>Recognizing the critical importance of correct and timely diagnoses in
ensuring patient safety, “Improving diagnosis for patient safety” has been
selected as the theme for World Patient Safety Day 2024.</p>
<p>Resolution WHA72.6 and the <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Patient Safety Action Plan 2021-2030</a> highlight
the need for ensuring the safety of diagnostic processes. The global action
plan encourages countries to adopt strategies that reduce diagnostic errors,
which often arise from a combination of cognitive and system factors that
impact the recognition of patients’ key signs and symptoms, and the interpretation
and communication of their test results.</p>
<p>A diagnostic error is the failure to establish a correct and timely explanation
of a patient’s health problem, which can include delayed, incorrect, or
missed diagnoses, or a failure to communicate that explanation to the patient.
The magnitude of diagnostic errors is profound, accounting for nearly 16%
of preventable harm across health systems. With most adults likely to face
at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, substantial work needs
to be done to improve the safety of diagnostic processes.</p>
