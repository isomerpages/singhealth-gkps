<p>Open disclosure is an open discussion with patients about incidents that
harm them while receiving health care. Although open disclosure of patient
safety occurrences is an important issue in the health care sector, since
it can reduce PSIs, research on this topic is scarce in Indonesia. There
has not been much research are few studies in Indonesia that investigate
health workers’ perspectives on PSI disclosure. Health workers’ viewpoints
on PSI open disclosure must be understood to promote patient safety.</p>
<p>This study examined how health staff in Indonesian hospitals perceived
open disclosure of patient safety incidents (PSIs). To the best of our
knowledge, this was the first mixed method study in Indonesia to investigate
health workers’ perspectives on incident disclosure.</p>
<p>Open disclosure is novel for Indonesian health professionals. A good open
disclosure system in hospitals could address several issues such as lack
of knowledge, lack of policy support, lack of training, and lack of policy.
To limit the negative implications of disclosing situations, the government
should develop supportive policies at the national level and organize many
initiatives at the hospital level.</p>
