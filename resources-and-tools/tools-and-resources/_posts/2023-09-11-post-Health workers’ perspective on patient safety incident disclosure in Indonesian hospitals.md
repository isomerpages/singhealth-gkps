Dhamanti, I., Juliasih, N. N., Semita, I. N., Zakaria, N., Guo, H. R., & Sholikhah, V. (2023). Health workers’ perspective on patient safety incident disclosure in Indonesian hospitals: a mixed-methods study. Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare, 1337-1348.

Open disclosure is an open discussion with patients about incidents that harm them while receiving health care. Although open disclosure of patient safety occurrences is an important issue in the health care sector, since it can reduce PSIs, research on this topic is scarce in Indonesia. There has not been much research are few studies in Indonesia that investigate health workers’ perspectives on PSI disclosure. Health workers’ viewpoints on PSI open disclosure must be understood to promote patient safety.

This study examined how health staff in Indonesian hospitals perceived open disclosure of patient safety incidents (PSIs). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first mixed method study in Indonesia to investigate health workers’ perspectives on incident disclosure. 

Open disclosure is novel for Indonesian health professionals. A good open disclosure system in hospitals could address several issues such as lack of knowledge, lack of policy support, lack of training, and lack of policy. To limit the negative implications of disclosing situations, the government should develop supportive policies at the national level and organize many initiatives at the hospital level.
