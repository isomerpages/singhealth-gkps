<p>There was a significant increase in nursing students' knowledge, self-efficacy,
and system thinking after participating in this short Patient Safety course.</p>
<p>Replication at a national level may improve safety knowledge and skills
among nursing students, with subsequent gains in Pakistan's healthcare
delivery safety.</p>
