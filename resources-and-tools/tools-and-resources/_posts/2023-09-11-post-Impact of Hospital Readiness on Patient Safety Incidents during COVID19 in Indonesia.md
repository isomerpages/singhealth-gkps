<p>Information on the impact of hospital readiness for patient safety during
the pandemic in Indonesia is still limited, emphasizing the need to investigate
these factors. Health care facilities across Indonesia should prepare to
implement measures for an efficient hospital-wide approach to managing
the impending surge in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. This study examined
the impact of hospital readiness on patient safety from the health care
workersâ€™ perspective involving online survey of 235 health care workers
at COVID-19 referral hospitals, followed by an interview with 11 participants
from various hospital types.</p>
