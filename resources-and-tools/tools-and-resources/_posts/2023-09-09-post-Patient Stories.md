Patient stories wield significant influence in driving patient safety and fostering improvement within the health care system. These narratives establish a vital human connection, making it possible for health care facilities and professionals to better appreciate and grasp the impact of their actions and decisions on patients' lives.

By sharing their experiences, patients put a relatable face to health care issues, evoking empathy and a sense of urgency and purpose among health care facilities and professionals.
