<p>The harmonized Cross-Institutions Infection Control (CIIC) Audit Tools
are adapted from validated national and international guidelines designed
for each audit and refined for practical applications. The audit tools
are part of the CIIC collaborative model developed by the SingHealth Duke-NUS
Institute for Patient Safety &amp; Quality (IPSQ), to monitor health care
hygiene compliance for infection control and to build a safer system for
our patients, staff, and visitors.</p>
<p>The model is implemented through a three-pronged approach comprising the
audit tools, management and training of auditors, as well as a structured
audit process. It has demonstrated to be effective in ensuring a high level
of hygiene and safety for the cluster.</p>
<p>The CIIC audits are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of auditors
using the harmonized audit tools. The audits serve to assess risks, monitor
effectiveness, and promote infection control best practices across the
cluster to minimize the occurrence of healthcare-associated infections.
The compliance rates, findings and corrective actions for all audits are
reported in a timely manner to institution and cluster leadership for oversight.</p>
<p>The five harmonized CIIC Audit Tools are:</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cross Institution Environmental Hygiene (CIEH)</strong> Audit
Tool. The focus of the CIEH Audit Tool is on dirt and blood in the environment,
equipment and furniture. Processes audited include glucometer maintenance
to eliminate blood stains, cleaning of equipment between use, storage of
sterile items, accessibility of alcohol-based wipes and hand washing facilities,
and knowledge of housekeeping staff on the use of different coloured cloths
for cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cross Institution Hand Hygiene (CIHH)</strong> Audit
Tool. The CIHH Audit Tool is aligned with the World Health Organization
(WHO) Five Moments for Hand Hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Cross Institution Kitchen Hygiene (CIKH)</strong> Audit
Tool. The CIKH Audit Tool was adopted from the Singapore Ministry of Health
(MOH) Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Audit Tool. The focus is to
maintain kitchen hygiene through checks on environment cleanliness, food
storage, staff hygiene and cleaning of equipment processes.</p>
<p><strong>(iv)</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Cross Institution Endoscopy Reprocessing (CIER)</strong> Audit
Tool. The CIER Audit Tool was adopted from the MOH IPC Audit Tool, to ensure
compliance and hygiene by checking on Endoscopy reprocessing and storage
of sterile supplies.</p>
<p><strong>(v)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cross Institution Sterile Processing (CISP)</strong> Audit
Tool. The CISP Audit Tool was adopted from the Asia Pacific Society of
Infection Control (APSIC) checklist, to ensure compliance and hygiene by
checking on sterilisation processes and storage of sterile supplies.</p>
