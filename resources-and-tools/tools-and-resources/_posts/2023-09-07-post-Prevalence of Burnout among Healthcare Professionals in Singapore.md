<hr>
<p>The aim was to study the prevalence of burnout among various groups of
health care professionals in Singapore.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess and compare burnout
level of health care professional groups in Singapore. There was high prevalence
of burnout among health care professional groups with significant differences
in the 3 burnout categories:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>emotional exhaustion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depersonalisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personal accomplishment</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The study supports the need to address burnout of all health care professional
groups. The data help to guide policy and efforts to improve the burnout
of health care professionals and how we can create a safe working environment
for health care workers.</p>
<p>Note: We used the MBI-HSS, a validated tool for measuring burnout. It
is designed for professionals in the human service settings with direct
contact with recipients, which in our settings, applies to patients, caregivers
or colleagues. MBI comprises 3 scales: the emotional exhaustion (EE) scale
measures feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one’s
work; the depersonalisation (DP) scale measures an unfeeling and impersonal
response towards the recipients of one’s service, care treatment or instruction;
and the scale on personal accomplishment (PA) determines feelings of competence
and successful achievement in one’s work. Each scale consists of multiple
questionnaires over a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 6 (every day)
to assess frequency of the feeling that the respondent has experienced
related to the scale. Each scale is scored individually and interpreted
separately. The scales are not aggregated, and as with most published studies
that used the MBI tool, we adopt the following as cut-off levels for the
respective scores for burnout: EE score ≥27(high), DP score ≥10 (high)
or PA score ≤33 (low)</p>
