<p>The medical students exhibited increases in knowledge, self-efficacy,
and system thinking after this week-long intervention.</p>
<p>The design of the course can be modified as needed and implemented at
other institutions in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>A targeted long-term assessment of knowledge and attitudes is needed to
fully evaluate the impact of this course.</p>
