<p>Patient engagement &amp; partnership to improve health care and elevate
the patient experience, can work well in a community in Asia, where patient
partnership is a new concept. Using the development of SingHealth Patient
Advocacy Network (SPAN) as the case study, the key factors for enabling
the successful development of patient partnership and patient advocacy,
are distilled. SPAN secretariat, together with the SPAN leaders, continues
to seek further directions and to expand its work to elevate the patient
experience, improve patient safety, amplify patient voices and to grow
the body of knowledge on patient engagement and patient advocacy for the
Asian community.</p>
<p>The SingHealth Patient Advocacy Network (SPAN) is a self-driven network
of patients and caregivers that represents the collective voice of patients.
As Patient Advocates, they are committed to making a positive impact on
health care and work in close partnership with the health care team to
provide important patient and family perspectives to enhance the patient
experience and quality of care. Click to visit SPAN <a href="https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/ipsq/singhealth-patient-advocacy-network" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Website</a>
