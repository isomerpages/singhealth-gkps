The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense pressure on healthcare facilities, especially in East Java Province, where mortality rates have been alarmingly high. In response to the pressing need to comprehend the psychological experiences of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients, this study has adopted a qualitative approach. This method seeks to delve deeply into the intricate nuances of their work and experiences, uncovering hidden insights that may elude conventional questionnaires.

The study employed a phenomenological qualitative approach, focusing on the psychological experiences of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in East Java Province, Indonesia. Through snowball purposive sampling, 16 frontline nurses actively involved in treating COVID-19 patients at the COVID Referral Hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, from March to August 2020 were selected.
