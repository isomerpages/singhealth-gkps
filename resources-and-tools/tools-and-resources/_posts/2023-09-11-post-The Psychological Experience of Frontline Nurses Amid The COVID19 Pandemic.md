<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense pressure on healthcare
facilities, especially in East Java Province, where mortality rates have
been alarmingly high. In response to the pressing need to comprehend the
psychological experiences of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients,
this study has adopted a qualitative approach. This method seeks to delve
deeply into the intricate nuances of their work and experiences, uncovering
hidden insights that may elude conventional questionnaires.</p>
<p>The study employed a phenomenological qualitative approach, focusing on
the psychological experiences of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients
in East Java Province, Indonesia. Through snowball purposive sampling,
16 frontline nurses actively involved in treating COVID-19 patients at
the COVID Referral Hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, from March to August
2020 were selected.</p>
