The [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan) on Patient and Family Engagement Co-Creation Consensus Workshop was held at the [3rd Asia-Pacific Patients Congress 2021 ](https://www.iapo.org.uk/asia-pacific-patients-congress).

The workshop was crafted to support Strategic Objective 4, which advocates for Engaging and Empowering Patients and Families to help and support the journey to safer health care. It brought together various stakeholders, particularly patients and patient advocates to discuss how they can share views and suggest action plans to contribute in accelerating GPSAP 2021-2030, Strategic Objective 4. 

Voices from patients offers a different perspective in the care process and it is important to integrate their opinions into designing a safer health care system. For patients to be empowered, all stakeholders in the health system need to recognize the importance of shared decision.

**Workshop Objectives:**

* Create awareness of strategic direction and recommendations from the 5 strategies in GPSAP 2021-2030, Strategic Objective 4: Patient and Family Engagement (Engage and empower patients and families to help and support the journey to safer health care.
* Facilitate consensus building by Patient Advocate Leads in Asia Pacific. The session should lead to agreement and support for an Asia-Pacific Patient Advocacy Consensus for Patient Safety as guided by the 5 strategies in Strategic Objective 4, namely:
* Engage patients, families and civil society organizations in coâ€‘development of policies, plans, strategies, programmes and guidelines to make health care safer (Strategy 4.1)
