<hr>
<p>Introduced in 2019, the Patient Safety Engagement Report (PASER) provides
a regular overview of patient safety indicators and engagement efforts
across the health care facilities within a health care cluster in Singapore
(SingHealth). It aims to strengthen commitment and accountability for patient
safety, improvement efforts, and identify opportunities for cluster-wide
sharing and learning as part of the learning framework within the cluster
Academic Medical Centre (AMC) learning organisation.</p>
<p>There are five categories with 13 main indicators. The five categories
are Leadership Patient Safety Walk Round, Serious Reportable Events &amp;
Reportable Near-Misses, Audits, Training Programs and Other Engagements
(which include Patient Safety Awards, Patient Safety Index, Clinical Excellence
Indicators (Safety) and Patient Safety Sharing).</p>
<p>The PASER indicators are tracked on quarterly basis and reported during
the leadership meeting to encourage institutions to have active patient
safety engagements. PASER is neither aimed at encouraging competition between
institutions nor be a tool for punitive actions. Rather, it seeks to identify
existing and potential patient safety issues and to facilitate communication
and engagement to categorize and resolve these matters at department, institutional
or cluster levels. In highlighting problem areas and formulating learning
points to address them, PASER also supports the organizationâ€™s goal of
becoming a learning healthcare system (refer to Reference).</p>
