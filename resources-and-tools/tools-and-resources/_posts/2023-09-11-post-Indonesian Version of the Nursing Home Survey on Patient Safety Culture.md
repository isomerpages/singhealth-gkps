Quality long-term care for older adults is crucial as the aging population in Indonesia continues to grow. This care spans various services, including nursing homes catering to individuals with complex health needs. 

However, nursing home residents often face physical frailty, cognitive challenges, and functional limitations, making them susceptible to patient safety incidents such as falls and pressure ulcers. These incidents can arise from inadequate monitoring, medical errors, poor communication, etc.

Ensuring patient safety in nursing homes is critical, given the vulnerable nature of older residents. Staff in nursing homes often work tirelessly but may be under appreciated.

To assess and improve patient safety culture in nursing homes, it's essential to have appropriate measurement tools. This study aims to validate and assess the psychometric properties of the Indonesian version of the NHSOPSC (NHSOPSC-INA) by gathering perceptions from staff in Indonesian nursing homes. A valid NHSOPSC-INA can serve as a tool to measure safety culture in nursing homes across Indonesia.
