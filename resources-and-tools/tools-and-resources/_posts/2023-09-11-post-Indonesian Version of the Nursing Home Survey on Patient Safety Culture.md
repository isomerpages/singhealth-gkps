<p>Quality long-term care for older adults is crucial as the aging population
in Indonesia continues to grow. This care spans various services, including
nursing homes catering to individuals with complex health needs.</p>
<p>However, nursing home residents often face physical frailty, cognitive
challenges, and functional limitations, making them susceptible to patient
safety incidents such as falls and pressure ulcers. These incidents can
arise from inadequate monitoring, medical errors, poor communication, etc.</p>
<p>Ensuring patient safety in nursing homes is critical, given the vulnerable
nature of older residents. Staff in nursing homes often work tirelessly
but may be under appreciated.</p>
<p>To assess and improve patient safety culture in nursing homes, it's essential
to have appropriate measurement tools. This study aims to validate and
assess the psychometric properties of the Indonesian version of the NHSOPSC
(NHSOPSC-INA) by gathering perceptions from staff in Indonesian nursing
homes. A valid NHSOPSC-INA can serve as a tool to measure safety culture
in nursing homes across Indonesia.</p>
