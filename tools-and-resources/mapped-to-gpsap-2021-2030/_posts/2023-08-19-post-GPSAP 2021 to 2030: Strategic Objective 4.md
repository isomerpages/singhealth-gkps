**Strategic Objective 4, Patient and Family Engagement**, focuses on engaging and empowering patients and families to help and support the journey to safer health care. The 5 key strategies are:

* Strategy 4.1: Engage patients, families and civil society organizations in coâ€‘development of policies, plans, strategies, programmes and guidelines to make health care safer.
* Strategy 4.2: Learn from the experience of patients and families exposed to unsafe care to improve understanding of the nature of harm and foster the development of more effective solutions.
* Strategy 4.3: Build the capacity of patient advocates and champions in patient safety.
* Strategy 4.4: Establish the principle and practice of openness and transparency throughout health care, including through patient safety incident disclosure to patients and families.
* Strategy 4.5: Provide information and education to patients and families for their involvement in selfcare and empower them for shared decision-making.

Refer to [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan) for the detailed framework for action through the 7 Strategic Objectives and 35 strategies. Each strategy is further operationalized into suggested actions for four key groups or categories of partners: governments, health care facilities and services, stakeholders and the WHO Secretariat.
