**Strategic Objective 3, Safety of Clinical Processes**, focuses on assuring the safety of every clinical process. The 5 key strategies are:

* Strategy 3.1: Identify all riskprone clinical procedures and mitigate their risks, taking account of national and local priorities.
* Strategy 3.2: Implement a programme to transform the safety of medication management and use based on the third WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge: Medication Without Harm.
* Strategy 3.3: Put in place rigorous and evidence-based measures for infection prevention and control to minimize the occurrence of health care-associated infections and antimicrobial  resistance.
* Strategy 3.4: Assure the safety of medical devices, medicine, blood and blood products, vaccines and other medical products. 
* Strategy 3.5: Assure the safety of patients in all settings, including in mental health settings and care homes, with a focus on primary care and transitions of care.

Refer to [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan) for the detailed framework for action through the 7 Strategic Objectives and 35 strategies. Each strategy is further operationalized into suggested actions for four key groups or categories of partners: governments, health care facilities and services, stakeholders and the WHO Secretariat.
