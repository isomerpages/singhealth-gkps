SingHealth Patient Advocacy Network (SPAN) is a self-driven network of patients and caregivers that represents the collective voice of patients. As Patient Advocates, they are committed to making a positive impact on health care and work in close partnership with the health care team to provide important patient and family perspectives to enhance the patient experience and quality of care.

Established in March 2017, SPAN is strategically guided by the Patient and Caregiver Engagement Framework for the SingHealth cluster, and works in close partnership with SingHealth Group Office of Patient Experience, SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute for Patient Safety & Quality (IPSQ) and SingHealth Group Nursing. SPAN is a reflection of SingHealthâ€™s commitment to designing a healthcare system that is truly for patients, by patients.

Produced in collaboration with over 40 patient support groups in SingHealth, the Plain English Glossary aims to help healthcare professionals better engage patients/caregivers by using words and terms that they would understand.
