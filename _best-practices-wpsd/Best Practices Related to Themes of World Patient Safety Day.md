Annually, World Patient Safety Day falls on 17 September
------------------------------
Annually on World Patient Safety Day, all nations and international allies are encouraged to collaborate and take action to enhance patient safety globally. The event unites patients, families, caregivers, communities, health care professionals, leaders, and policymakers in demonstrating their dedication to patient safety. 

Recognizing the central role that patients, their families and caregivers play in advancing safe care, “Engaging patients for patient safety” is the theme for [World Patient Safety Day 2023](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day/2023). 

Here are some submitted resources and tools aligned to Strategic Objective 4 - Patient and Family Engagement of the [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan).
