### Clean Care is Safer Care

Launched in 2005, Clean Care is Safer Care was the inaugural WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge.

The Global Patient Safety Challenge, a core programme of the World Alliance for Patient Safety, brings together the [WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/66334/retrieve) with ongoing actions on blood safety, injection and immunization safety, safer clinical practices, and safe water, sanitation and waste management. Simple actions contained in these low-cost strategies have also proven to be very effective in reducing the burden of infection.

The aim of these Guidelines is to provide health care workers(HCWs), hospital administrators and health authorities with a thorough review of evidence on hand hygiene in health care and speciÔ¨Åc recommendations for improving practices and reducing the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients and HCWs. They have been developed with a global perspective, not addressing developed nor developing countries but rather all countries, while encouraging adaptation to the local situation according to the resources available.
