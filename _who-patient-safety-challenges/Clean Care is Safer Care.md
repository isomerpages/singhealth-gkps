### Clean Care is Safer Care

Launched in 2005, Clean Care is Safer Care was the inaugural WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge.

The Global Patient Safety Challenge, a core programme of the World Alliance for Patient Safety, brings together the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care with ongoing actions on blood safety, injection and immunization safety, safer clinical practices, and safe water, sanitation and waste management. Simple actions contained in these low-cost strategies have also proven to be very effective in reducing the burden of infection.
