<h3>Clean Care is Safer Care</h3><p>Launched in 2005, Clean Care is Safer Care was the inaugural WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge.</p><p>The Global Patient Safety Challenge, a core programme of the World Alliance for Patient Safety, brings together the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/66334/retrieve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care</a> with ongoing actions on blood safety, injection and immunization safety, safer clinical practices, and safe water, sanitation and waste management. Simple actions contained in these low-cost strategies have also proven to be very effective in reducing the burden of infection.</p><p>The aim of these Guidelines is to provide health care workers(HCWs), hospital administrators and health authorities with a thorough review of evidence on hand hygiene in health care and speciÔ¨Åc recommendations for improving practices and reducing the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients and HCWs. They have been developed with a global perspective, not addressing developed nor developing countries but rather all countries, while encouraging adaptation to the local situation according to the resources available.</p>
