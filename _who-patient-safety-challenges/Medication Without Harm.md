### Medication Without Harm

Launched in 2017, [Medication Without Harm](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm), is the third WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge. It aims to bring solutions to address the many obstacles the world faces today to ensure the safety of medication practices. WHOâ€™s goal is to achieve widespread engagement and commitment of WHO Member States and professional bodies around the world to reducing the harm associated with medication.

**GOAL**: to reduce severe avoidable medication-related harm by 50%, globally in the next 5 years.
