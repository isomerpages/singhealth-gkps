### Global Patient Safety Challenge

The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Patient Safety Challenge to address pressing issues of patient harm in health care settings. Since 2005, the challenges were initiated to raise awareness, drive actions and promote strategies for improving patient safety on a global scale.

Key elements of the challenges include focus on:

1. Areas of priority on specific areas as guided by the theme of each challenge
2. Guidelines and recommendations as well as best practices to assist health care facilities, professionals and stakeholders in implementing effective strategies to enhance patient safety
3. Data collection and sharing to provide essential understanding of the scope of focus and improvement change made
4. Capacity building as each challenge often involve capacity building efforts such as training to equip health care professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills
5. Global collaboration between countries, health care facilities, and stakeholders to share experiences, successes and challenges in improving patient safety.

The Global Patient Safety Challenges introduced to-date are:

1. [Medication Without Harm in 2017](/medicationwithoutharm/)
2. [Safe Surgery Saves Lives in 2008](/safesurgerysaveslives/)
3. [Clean Care is Safer Care in 2005](/cleancareissafercare/)

In this improvement journey, we invite you to share your patient safety improvement experiences, aligned to the [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan). Your sharing will contribute to robust global knowledge sharing for patient safety.
