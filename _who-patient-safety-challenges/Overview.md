### Global Patient Safety Challenge

The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Patient Safety Challenge to address pressing issues of patient harm in healthcare settings. Since 2005, the challenges were initiated to raise awareness, drive actions and promote strategies for improving patient safety on a global scale.

Key elements of the challenges include focus on:
1) Areas of priority on specific areas as guided by the theme of each challenge
2) Guidelines and recommendations as well as best practices to assist healthcare facilities, professionals and stakeholders in implementing effective strategies to enhance patient safety
3) Data collection and sharing to provide essential understanding of the scope of focus and improvement change made
4) Capacity building as each challenge often involve capacity building efforts such as training to equip healthcare professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills
5) Global collaboration between countries, healthcare facilities, and stakeholders to share experiences, successes and challenges in improving patient safety.
