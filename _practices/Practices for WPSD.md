17 September is World Patient Safety Day
------------------------------
On World Patient Safety Day [(WPSD](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day)), all nations and international allies are encouraged to collaborate and take action to enhance patient safety globally. The event unites patients, families, caregivers, communities, health care professionals, leaders, and policymakers in demonstrating their dedication to patient safety.

The Global action on patient safety resolution (WHA 72.6) acknowledges patient safety as a global health focus area & priority, and approves the annual observance of World Patient Safety Day on September 17th. The theme and slogan of WPSD change every year, and this page aims to share best practices on the annual theme to support WPSD.

Recognizing the central role that patients, their families and caregivers play in advancing safe care, “Engaging patients for patient safety” has been selected as the theme for [World Patient Safety Day 2023](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day/2023). Evidence shows that when patients are treated as partners in their care, significant gains are made in safety, patient satisfaction and health outcomes. Resolution WHA72.6 urges Members States “to put into place systems to support the active engagement, participation and empowerment of patients, families and communities in the delivery of safer health care”. In order to shift the paradigm of patient-centredness from care designed “for patients” to care designed “with patients”, patient and family engagement has been included as one of the seven strategic objectives of the Global Patient Safety Action Plan 2021–2030 and will now be the focus of the global campaign for this year’s World Patient Safety Day.

Through the slogan “Elevate the voice of patients!”, WHO calls on all stakeholders to take necessary action to ensure that patients are involved in policy formulation, are represented in governance structures, are engaged in co-designing safety strategies, and are active partners in their own care. There is a need to provide plaforms at global, national and local levels to enable patients and their families to make their voices heard and share their experiences of safe and unsafe care; and to ensure that they are engaged and empowered, and their insights are used as a vital source of learning and improvement.

**Objectives of World Patient Safety Day 2023:**

* Raise global awareness of the need for active engagement of patients and their families and caregivers in all settings and at all levels of health care to improve patient safety.
* Engage policy-makers, health care leaders, health and care workers, patients’ organizations, civil society and other stakeholders in efforts to engage patients and families in the policies and practices for safe health care.
* Empower patients and families to be actively involved in their own health care and in the improvement of safety of health care.
* Advocate urgent action on patient and family engagement, aligned with the Global Patient Safety Action Plan 2021–2030, to be taken by all partners.
