Avoidable adverse events, errors and risks associated with health care remain a challenges for patient safety globally. The Seventy-second World Health Assembly in 2019 adopted resolution WHA72.6 on global action on patient safety and mandated for development ofÂ  a global patient safety action plan. 

The Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030 provides a framework to develop action plans on patient safety, as well to align existing strategic instruments for improving patient safety in all clinical and health-related programmes. 

In fostering a global community of learning, we encourage patient safety practitioners, experts and leaders like yourselves to submit practices for sharing with the community and more importantly to form collaborations to advance patient safety and quality of care.
