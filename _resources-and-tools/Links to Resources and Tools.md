Patient safety is a dynamic and evolving field, driven by advancements in medical knowledge, technology and best practices. Staying informed and equipped with the right resources is essential for health care providers, facilities, and policymakers alike. From guidelines to protocols to incident reporting systems and educational materials, this collection of links to patient safety resources and tools, mapped to relevant strategic objectives of the Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030, is organised in a systematic form, making it a valuable reference source for you to seek quick access to essential resources in patient safety.

Our commitment is to continually update and expand this collection to ensure that it remains relevant to help you in your efforts to promote patient safety. 

Join us on this journey as we navigate to strengthen patient safety, where every link is a step toward safer, more reliable health care practices. Together, we can contribute to eliminating avoidable harm.

In accessing the collections of links, we encourage you to contribute to update the collections by sharing links to resources and tools. If you are keen to submit resources and tools instead of sharing links, please submit via this online form:
