Patient safety is a dynamic and evolving field, driven by advancements in medical knowledge, technology and best practices. Staying informed and equipped with the right resources is essential for health care providers, facilities, and policymakers alike. From guidelines to protocols to incident reporting systems and educational materials, this collection of links to patient safety resources and tools, mapped to relevant strategic objectives of the [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan), is organised in a systematic form, making it a valuable reference source for you to seek quick access to essential resources in patient safety.

Our commitment is to continually update and expand this collection to ensure that it remains relevant to help you in your efforts to promote patient safety. While you access the collections of links, we would also like to encourage you to contribute by sharing links to useful patient safety resources and tools:
