Policy-makers, political leaders, and healthcare authorities across the globe have acknowledged the advantages of adopting a well-planned and unified strategy for patient safety. This comprehensive approach focuses on identifying common causes of harm and implementing preventive measures. The culmination of global advocacy efforts was witnessed in the approval of resolution WHA72.6 titled "Global action on patient safety" by the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in 2019. The Global Patient Safety Action Plan 2021-2030 was endorsed by the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in 2021.

[GPSAP](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240032705) provides guidance to eliminate harm and improve patient safety in healthcare through policies on safety and quality, and recommendations at the point of care through 7 Strategic Objectives (SOs) and 35 strategies.
