World Patient Safety Day (WPSD) is one of WHO’s global public health days. 

It was established in 2019 by the Seventy-second World Health Assembly through the adoption of resolution WHA72.6 – “Global action on patient safety”. 

The theme and slogan of WPSD change every year, and this page shares best practices on the annual theme to support WPSD.
