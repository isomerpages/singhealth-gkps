Welcome to the World Health Organization Global Knowledge Sharing Platform for Patient Safety (GKPS).

GKPS is an online platform, a public domain to facilitate systematic collection and sharing of patient safety knowledge by different stakeholders in different geographic regions, economic and cultural settings.

GKPS also aims to share practices as guided by the theme of each [World Patient Safety Day](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day) (WPSD) as well as sharing of knowledge and training on reporting and learning systems on patient safety. The goal is to connect key stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of patient safety and improvement practices, reporting, and learning systems by sharing methods, tools and experiences of safety champions and local health care professionals, to accelerate current dissemination of patient safety and improvement strategies and learnings.

GKPS as the global community of learning aims to support and enhance knowledge sharing and to strengthen the networks all around the globe to improve safety and quality of care and in driving the [Global Patient Safety Action Plan](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan). 

An International Advisory Group (IAG) will develop the strategic focus areas of GKPS and provide advice in the development of the technical content.

Together, we learn, share and advance patient safety. No one should be left behind in building and advancing safety and quality of care.
