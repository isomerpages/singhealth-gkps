17 September is World Patient Safety Day
------------------------------
On World Patient Safety Day [(WPSD](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day)), all nations and international allies are encouraged to collaborate and take action to enhance patient safety globally. The event unites patients, families, caregivers, communities, health care professionals, leaders, and policymakers in demonstrating their dedication to patient safety. The Global action on patient safety resolution (WHA 72.6) acknowledges patient safety as a global health focus area & priority, and approves the annual observance of World Patient Safety Day on September 17th. The theme and slogan of WPSD change every year, and this page aims to share best practices on the annual theme to support WPSD. 

Recognizing the central role that patients, their families and caregivers play in advancing safe care, “Engaging patients for patient safety” has been selected as the theme for [World Patient Safety Day 2023](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-patient-safety-day/2023). Through the slogan “Elevate the voice of patients!”, WHO calls on all stakeholders to take necessary action to ensure that patients are involved in policy formulation, are represented in governance structures, are engaged in co-designing safety strategies, and are active partners in their own care. There is a need to provide plaforms at global, national and local levels to enable patients and their families to make their voices heard and share their experiences of safe and unsafe care; and to ensure that they are engaged and empowered, and their insights are used as a vital source of learning and improvement.

Share your practices that that are aligned to the respective theme of each World Patient Safety Day. Submitted practices will be reviewed by the IAG for sharing with the Global Patient Safety Network [(GPSN)](https://ezcollab.who.int/gpsn):
