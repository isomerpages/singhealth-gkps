The Seventy-second World Health Assembly in 2019 adopted resolution WHA72.6 on global action on patient safety and mandated for development ofÂ  a global patient safety action plan. 

The Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030 provides a framework to develop action plans on patient safety, as well to align existing strategic instruments for improving patient safety in all clinical and health-related programmes.
