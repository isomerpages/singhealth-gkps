WHO established the WHO Global Patient Safety (GPS) Network with the objective to provide a global platform for sharing experiences, approaches, resources, ideas, and opportunities for bilateral and multilateral collaboration in order to support health care safety improvement efforts.

GPS Network aims to connect actors and stakeholders from national and international patient safety agencies and organizations; ministries of health - focal points at all levels from WHO Member States and WHO offices; and all partners and stakeholders. The secretariat of this network is hosted by the WHO Patient Safety Flagship “A Decade of Patient Safety 2020-2030” in the Integrated Health Services Department at the WHO headquarters in Geneva.

In 2023, the WHO Asia-Pacific Patient Safety (APPS) Network was established to provide a robust platform for Asia-Pacific patient safety practitioners and experts to share practices, approaches, resources, ideas, experiences and opportunities in patient safety; to support building high reliability health care in the Asia-Pacific. APPS Network is aligned to [Global Patient Safety Action Plan (GPSAP) 2021-2030](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/policy/global-patient-safety-action-plan), with the aim to eliminate avoidable harm in healthcare, in order to scale up its implementation and facilitate real-time discussions on patient safety issues in the Asia-Pacific, to collectively work on possible patient safety solutions.

We welcome you to join both networks to actively share best practices and connect with patient safety experts and practitioners around the world and its regions:
